# PCA (Principal Component Analysis) — Theory and Visualization

This repository contains an in-depth notebook explaining the theory and intuition behind **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**.  
It covers the mathematical foundations, eigen decomposition, explained variance, dimensionality reduction steps, and visual exploration of transformed components.

##  Notebook Included
- **PCA(principle_component_analysis) (1).ipynb**

This notebook includes:
- What PCA is and why it is used  
- Standardization before applying PCA  
- Covariance matrix and eigen decomposition  
- Principal components and loadings  
- Explained variance & scree plots  
- Visualizing PCA in 2D/3D  
- Dimensionality reduction on sample datasets  
- Interpreting transformed features  

---

##  Objective
To build a strong conceptual understanding of PCA through:
- Step-by-step mathematical explanation  
- Hands-on coding implementation  
- Visual demonstrations of feature reduction  
- Understanding variance retention and information loss  

This serves as a solid foundation for ML workflows involving high-dimensional data.
